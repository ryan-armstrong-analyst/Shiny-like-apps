Interactive Data Analysis Apps and Statistics Tools

I personally am both a visual and kinesthetic learner, and I have found that little visual interactive tools are really helpful in helping me absorb statistical concepts. So these tools are great as learning tools for statistical concepts for students, but are also teaching me to make these sorts of interactive applications, which has uses in professional and research settings.
